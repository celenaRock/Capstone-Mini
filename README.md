This customer required 2 critical features:
1.	Website must include a function to use her own drawings to accessories her unicorn with her designs.
2.	The artist must receive a spotlight and credit somewhere in the website with her face over a rainbow.
I took the liberty to make the gallery, if you would like to leave a comment.
